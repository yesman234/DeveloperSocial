 Hello Welcome, and thank you for visiting my github profile. 
     To this application simply cd into client and install your modules (npm i install). Then cd .. and install your node modules once more (npm i install). Followed by using your own mongodb atlas url query string in the 'config/database.js' file. Finally use 'npm run dev' to start the application.
